## Kaggle Competition Notebooks
This repository serves as a collection of competition projects for my participated competitions on Kaggle where opens competition in Data Science and AI development for developers around the world. It contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and supporting files used to develop and submit solutions for various Kaggle challenges and competitions.

## Introduction to Kaggle Competitions
Kaggle competitions provide a platform for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to test their skills on real-world problems and scenarios with real-world dataset to bring Data Science and AI for solving those problems, including business problems and none-business problems. Participants are tasked with building the best possible models to solve a specific challenge. The final ranking of each participant is calculated based on a hidden test dataset, and the score is determined by the competition's objective and evaluation metrics.

## Repository Core Principles
Each notebook within this repository is designed to be a comprehensive walkthrough of my solution with theories and concepts behind my solution of each competition, including each problem statement and data decription for each competition. The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible, techniques, and educational resource that documents the entire process, from data exploration and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and model inference.

## Participated Competitions
Below is a list of the competitions documented in this repository, with shorts description of them. I have attached link of each competion in each competition notebook, and dataset of each competition can download from each competition webpage.
- **CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions :** Improve prediction of transplant survival rates equitably for allogeneic HCT patients.
- **Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge :** Use historical product sales data to predict future sales.
- **Beyond Visible Spectrum: AI for Agriculture 2025:** Automated Crop Disease Diagnosis from Hyperspectral Imagery 4th.
- **FlightRank 2025: Aeroclub RecSys Cup:** Personalized Flight Recommendations for Business Travelers.
- **PHEMS Hackathon: Pediatric Sepsis Prediction:** Development of machine learning algorithms to predict pediatric sepsis in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

**Remark:** Each competition calculated final rank of competition for each paticipant base on each competition hidden test dataset and the score for each participant calculated follow each competition objective (evaluation metrics).

## Getting Started
To explore these projects, simply navigate to the topic folder or notebook of the competition. You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub or clone the repository to run them locally. Each notebook is designed to be a standalone guide to its respective topic with end-to-end of pipeline of solutions and methodologies for each competition, including competition detail, problem statement, dataset description, objective of competition, and competition's evaluation.

## Repository Structure
For each competition, a dedicated folder is created. The typical structure inside each folder is as follows:

<pre>
/main
    /compitition folders : It contains of notebooks that were used in competition, which is training model pipeline notebook and 
                           submission pipeline notebook. Due to, some competition required submission notebook for submit result 
                           of prediction. 
    
    /notebooks           : Contains the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) that detail the analysis and modeling process (model training 
                           and submission pipeline) for competitions that does not required submission notebook.
    
    /LICENSE             : License file for this repository, which is Apache 2.0.
    
    /README.md           : Provides a high-level overview of the competition, introduction about repository, and participate 
                           competitions.
