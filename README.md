## Kaggle Competition Notebooks
This repository serves as a collection of competition projects for my participated competitions on Kaggle where opens competition in Data Science and AI development for developers around the world. It contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and supporting files used to develop and submit solutions for various Kaggle challenges and competitions.

## Introduction to Kaggle Competitions
Kaggle competitions provide a platform for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to test their skills on real-world problems and scenarios with real-world dataset to bring Data Science and AI for solving those problems, including business problems and none-business problems. Participants are tasked with building the best possible models to solve a specific challenge. The final ranking of each participant is calculated based on a hidden test dataset, and the score is determined by the competition's objective and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started
Each notebook within this repository is designed to be a comprehensive walkthrough of my solution with theories and concepts behind my solution of each competition, including each problem statement and data decription for each competition. The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible, techniques, and educational resource that documents the entire process, from data exploration and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and model inference.

To explore these projects, simply navigate to the topic folder or notebook of the competition. You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub or clone the repository to run them locally. Each notebook is designed to be a standalone guide to its respective topic with end-to-end of pipeline of solutions and methodologies for each competition, including competition detail, problem statement, dataset description, objective of competition, and competition's evaluation.

## Repository Structure
For each competition, a dedicated folder is created. The typical structure inside each folder is as follows:

<pre>
/main
    /compitition folders     : Contains of notebooks that were used in competition, which is training model pipeline notebook and 
                               submission pipeline notebook. Due to, some competition required submission notebook for submit result 
                               of prediction. 
    
    /competition notebooks   : Contains the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) that detail the analysis and modeling process (model training 
                               and submission pipeline) for competitions that do not required submission notebook.
    
    /LICENSE                 : License file for this repository, which is Apache 2.0.
    
    /README.md               : Provides an information and introduction about repository.
